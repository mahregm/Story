 When working with git control there are different stages that we need to fulfil before commiting
 our work in the Github which is remote Repository.

 1. Working Directory: It is the current folder that we are working on and it is the file where we
 will start the git by typing "git init".

 
 2. Staging area: This is the area where we want to move the files that we want to keep track of. 
 If we add a file in the staging area then we will be able to see the changes that has been made previously
 and we can revert the changes. To add a file in the staging area we write the code "git add filename".
 
 
 3. Local Repository: It is a repository which is hosted on a local machine for an individual user. we add our 
 files to the local repository by writing a code "git commit filename".

 4. Remote Repository: It is hoseted on a remote (this could be on the internet or an off-site server;
 it could even be the same machine in a different path) and is shared among myultiple team members. The 
 best example of remote repository is Github repository. we add our file to the remote 
 repository by using "git remote add <name> <url> "


 What is the difference between Local Repository and Remote Repository?
 = A local repository is a copy of the entire project's history and codebase that resides on a developer's machine. 
 When a developer initializes a local repository, Git sets up the necessary infrastructure on track changes, branches, and commits
 within the project.
